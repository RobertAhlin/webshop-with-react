## Layout
Started to build a simple layout. using a header, footer, sidebar and a home area.
- **Header**  
The header should include a navbar
- **Footer**  
No plan yet, but perhaps some social media links?
- **Home**  
Just the main area where to navigate products. Aiming to use pagination.
- **Sidebar**  
This is where I plan to display the shopping cart where it should be easy to overview what's been added. Also easy to edit amount and remove products.
