First page directly shows the available items that is collected from DummyJson. The page present the first eighteen items, if user what to show more items there is a button "Show more..." That will display eighteen more, and so on.
Clicking an item card will open a modal that will show more details about the item. And also it possible to add the item to the shopping cart. One item will be added. If add to cart is clicked again, the number of that item will increase in the the shopping cart. Closing the detail page of the item is done by clicking the "Close" button it top left corner.

Added items will be shown in a list where it is possible to increase or decrease the amount of each item the user wants to buy by clicking the "+" and "-" buttons. And also the option to delete an item from the shopping cart by clicking the "trash can" button.

## Layout
Started to build a simple layout. using a header, footer, sidebar and a home area.

No plan yet, but perhaps some social media links?

Just the main area where to navigate products. Aiming to use pagination.

This is where to display the shopping cart where it should be easy to overview what's been added. Also easy to edit amount and remove products.

The AddToCartButton component is a React component that renders a button. When clicked, it adds a given product to the cart.

The Modal component is a React component that displays a modal dialog for a product. It accepts four props: isOpen, onClose, product, and addToCart.

When open, it displays a modal overlay with the product's image, title, price, and description.  
There are two buttons: one to close the modal (triggers onClose) and one to add the product to the cart (triggers addToCart with the product as an argument).  
The component imports its styles from Modal.css.
